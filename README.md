# Lit

Lit is a lightweight version control system (a literal [Git](https://git-scm.com/) clone), written in Python.

## Getting Started

### Using `pipx`

[`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is used to install Python CLI applications globally while still isolating them in virtual environments.

1. Install `pipx`

   If `pipx` is not already installed, you can follow any of the options in the [official pipx installation instructions](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).

2. Install Lit

   ```bash
   pipx install git+https://github.com/RishikeshNK/lit.git
   ```

3. Update Lit

   ```bash
   pipx update git+https://github.com/RishikeshNK/lit.git
   ```

4. Uninstall Lit

   ```bash
   pipx uninstall git+https://github.com/RishikeshNK/lit.git
   ```
